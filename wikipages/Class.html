                    <hr>
                    <h6>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
                        fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
                        longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
                        in a net with some degree of skill, Likewise, a fighter is
                        adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
                        basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
                        certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
                        some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
                        on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
                        combination of broad general ability and extensive
                        specialization makes fighters superior combatants
                        on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
